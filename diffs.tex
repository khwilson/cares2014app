\section{Other Initiatives in Kentucky and How TEALS Differs}\label{sec:diffs}

There are several other technology initiatives around the state. Perhaps the
most well-publicized one is the Student Technology Leadership Program (STLP),
which is headed by the Kentucky Society for Technology in Education (KySTE).
The mission statement of KySTE is as follows:

\begin{quote}
The Mission of KySTE... is to empower the educational community in the
Commonwealth of Kentucky to infuse technology as an integral part of the
educational process through advocacy and leadership, promoting educational
excellence and supporting technology-based innovation \autocite{KySTEAboutUs}.
\end{quote}

What makes TEALS unique is its ability to get experts on computer science into
the classroom with teachers. In this way, experts can learn exactly what sort
of educational strategies work with the students in question, and teachers
can simultaneously learn a new field while helping the experts in their
teaching practice. This unique combination of outside technical excellence
and internal pedagogical excellence sets TEALS apart from other programs
in the state.
